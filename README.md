# Apollyon #

## What is Apollyon? ##
Apollyon is a Camera Plugin for Arcturus Morningstar

Apollyon uses a PNG Image, instead of JSON data to create the image, meaning while all of the Habbo Client is rendered in an image - it does not use the JSON Method implemented by the official Habbo Client.

As such, if a JSON Plugin is released - it will be recommended that you use that instead.

## FAQ ##
Q: I get this error when I take a picture '**You are using a Habbo.swf that has not been patched to work with Apollyon. Please read the read me on a guide to patching your swf, or download a prepatched one on our git at**'

A: You need to patch your camera using HabKit.

Download the software here: [habkit.zip](https://git.krews.org/morningstar/apollyon/uploads/a19154a56be31a6ed41f9b768ac8e65c/habkit.zip)

Unzip the folder, and open the net47 folder. Then add your Habbo.swf to the net47 folder. Use Command prompt and cd to the folder. type the following into cmd:

`HabKit.exe Habbo.swf /rawcam`
