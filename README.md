# Apollyon #

## What is Apollyon? ##
Apollyon is the official Camera Project for Arcturus Morningstar, it is backwards compatible with Arcturus Emulator by TheGeneral, if you wish to use it with the official arcturus software.

## Why should I use this instead of the official camera for Arcturus by TheGeneral? ##
Apollyon uses a PNG Image, instead of JSON data to create the image, meaning all customs and new furniture and clothing show up without needing TheGeneral to update his camera server.

## FAQ ##
Q: I get this error when I take a picture '**You are using a Habbo.swf that has not been patched to work with Apollyon. Please read the read me on a guide to patching your swf, or download a prepatched one on our git at**'

A: You need to patch your camera using HabKit.

Download the software here: [HabKit](https://git.krews.org/morningstar/apollyon/master/%5Bhabkit.zip%5D(/uploads/a19154a56be31a6ed41f9b768ac8e65c/habkit.zip))

Unzip the folder, and open the net47 folder. Then add your Habbo.swf to the net47 folder. Use Command prompt and cd to the folder. type the following into cmd:

`HabKit.exe Habbo.swf /rawcam`
